/*! \mainpage imagezero_image_transport
 *
 * This packages provides publisher and subscriber plugins for the
 * <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport">ROS image_transport</a> package.
 *
 * If you are looking for a way to convert between sensor_msgs::Image and
 * sensor_msgs::CompressedImage messages using the ImageZero compression algorithm,
 * you should look at the imagezero_ros package.
 *
 * If you are using image_transport, you do not need to directly use either of
 * these classes.  As long as this package is in your ROS package path, any
 * image_transport::Publishers will automatically publish an "imagezero" topic,
 * and any image_transport::Subscribers can be made to subscribe to it by
 * setting their ~image_transport parameter to "imagezero".
